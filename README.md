# AQA CS AS Notes

## 3.5 Fundamentals of data representation

### 3.5.1 Number systems
+ natural numbers

**definition**: those are numbers used for counting.

**examples**: 0,1,2,3,4
``` 

Counting uses natural numbers
A set of natural number can expressed as:
N={0,1,2,3...}

```

+ integer numbers

**Definiton**: Whole numbers.

**Examples**: -5,-1,4,7,9
```

Numbers such as 0.5 or surds are not integers

```


+ rational numbers

**Definiton**: Any number that can be written as a fraction

**Examples**: 1/2,4/5,9/13
```
				   	
Numbers such as √2 or Pi

```

+ irrational numbers

**Defintion**: Numbers that can't be expressed as a fraction or as a terminating decimal
					
**Examples**: Pi, √2
```

Numbers such as 1/2 or 1.4 are not irrational numbers

``` 


+ real numbers

**Definiton**: All numbers than are not imaginary numbers
						 
**Examples** 3,21,1/2, √2
```

An example of an imaginary number would be "i"

```


+ ordinal numbers

**Definiton**: Numbers that are used to indicated position in a list

**Examples**: 1st,2nd,3rd


### 3.5.2 Number bases
+ base 2: those are binary numbers. example: 1010<sub>2</sub>. See [this site](https://bournetocode.com/projects/AQA_AS_Theory/pages/3-5.html) for more infomation
+ base 10: Decimal numbers
+ base 16: Hexidecimal numbers
+ conversion between denary, binary and hex

```
Decimal   Binary   Hexidecimal
0		  0000     0
1		  0001     1
2		  0010     2
3		  0011 	   3
4		  0100	   4
5		  0101	   5
6		  0110	   6
7		  0111	   7
8		  1000	   8
9		  1001	   9
10		  1010	   A
11		  1011     B
12		  1100	   C
13		  1101	   D
14		  1110	   E
15		  1111	   F








### 3.5.3 Units of information
+ bit and bytes
+ units of kilo, kilbi etc

### 3.5.4 Binary number system

#### unsigned binary
#### unsigned binary arithmetics
#### signed binary with two's complement
#### fixed point form binary representation of numbers with fractional parts

### 3.5.5 Information encoding system

#### Character form of a decimal digit
#### ASCII and Unicode
#### Error checking and correction

### 3.5.6 Representing images, sound and other data

#### Bit patterns, images,  sound  and other  data
#### Analogue and digital
#### Analogue and digital conversion
#### Bitmapped graphics
#### Digital representation of sound
#### Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)
#### Data compression
#### Encryption
